morning weight : 235.5

morning 
- woke up at 3 in the morning :(
- 4 mile hike and breakfast with a friend, got to see the sunrise
- Got home and slept until 11
- At 11:30 went to a meetup for a group that I joined to build a trivia app in flutter
- The group is called flutterfly
- I'm going to pitch the idea of trying to use microservices, and in our case, specifically firestore, firbase auth, and potentially firbase's realtime database

- it went well, we're probably going to use firebase as the backend but there will be another meeting next week. Right now its a toss up between golang and firestore
- 

noon / afternoon 
- caught up on sleep, time for a night of work
  
evening
- watched a video, the Rise and Fall of Netscape
- Got through a flutter lesson
