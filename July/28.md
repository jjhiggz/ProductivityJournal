morning
- weight 232.5   :)
- when I woke up I felt super hungry, but also very alert
- I was up at 8 to do my morning group meeting but my computer crashed. It took 3-4 hours to backup the hard drive
- During that 3-4 hours I went for a run, and worked out

noon
- started working again
- made breakfast (salmon and potatoes)
- got really tired after and fell asleep until 3pm

afternoon
- Since I have a mock technical interview tomorrow at 2pm I plan on doing a metric fuck ton of code challenges today and nothing else.
